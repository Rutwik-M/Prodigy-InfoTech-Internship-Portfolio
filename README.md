## 📂 Project Index

### [1️⃣ Task 01: Predictive Housing Model (Regression)](https://github.com/Rutwik-M/PRODIGY_ML_01)
* **Objective:** Predict real estate prices based on structural features.
* **Tech Stack:** Linear Regression, Pandas, Scikit-Learn.
* **Key Innovation:** Implemented robust data preprocessing pipelines to handle outliers and minimize error rates (RMSE).

### [2️⃣ Task 02: Customer Segmentation (Clustering)](https://github.com/Rutwik-M/PRODIGY_ML_02)
* **Objective:** Group retail customers based on purchasing history for targeted marketing.
* **Tech Stack:** K-Means Clustering, Matplotlib, Seaborn.
* **Key Innovation:** Visualized distinct customer clusters (e.g., "High Spenders," "Budget Conscious") to drive actionable business insights.

### [3️⃣ Task 03: Explainable AI Classifier (SVM)](https://github.com/Rutwik-M/PRODIGY_ML_03)
* **Objective:** Classify images of dogs vs. cats using Support Vector Machines.
* **Tech Stack:** SVM, HOG Features, Flask, OpenCV.
* **Key Innovation:** **"Glass Box" UI** – A custom web interface that visualizes the HOG (Histogram of Oriented Gradients) features to explain *why* the model made a prediction.

### [5️⃣ Task 05: Smart Nutrition Engine (Deep Learning)](https://github.com/Rutwik-M/PRODIGY_ML_05)
* **Objective:** Classify food items and estimate nutritional content.
* **Tech Stack:** TensorFlow, MobileNetV2 (Transfer Learning), Custom Logic Layer.
* **Key Innovation:** **"Smart Engine"** – A post-processing logic layer that calculates a dynamic **Health Score (0-100)** and provides a health verdict based on macronutrients, rather than just a simple label.
